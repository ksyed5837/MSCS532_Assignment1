# MSCS532_Assignment1

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Insertion Sort algorithm** that sorts numbers in **monotonically decreasing order**.

## How It Works
The algorithm is based on the Insertion Sort method from Chapter 2 of "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS).  
The comparison is reversed so the largest numbers come first.

## How to Run
Open a terminal and run:

```
python insertion_sort.py
```

## Example Output
Original array: [12, 4, 5, 3, 8, 7]  
Sorted in decreasing order: [12, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3]
